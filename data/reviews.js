            Loved the course. I've learned some very subtle tecniques, expecially on leaves.

            I loved the course, it had been a long time since I had experimented with watercolors and now I will do it more often thanks to Kitani Studio

            Yes. I just emphasize that the use of Photoshop, for non-users, becomes difficult to follow. What requires a course to master it. Safe and very didactic teacher.

            I haven't finished the course yet, as I would like to have some feedback from the teacher, about the comments I shared on the forum 3 months ago, and I still haven't had any answer. 
            I think the course is well structured, however the explanations and videos are very quick for beginners. However, it is good to go practicing.
